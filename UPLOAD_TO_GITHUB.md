# Upload to GitHub - Step by Step Guide

## 📁 What's in This Folder

This "Companion App" folder contains everything you need to upload to GitHub for automatic building. Here's what each file does:

### 📂 Essential Files for GitHub:
- **`companion-app/`** - The complete source code of the Zoom Connection Plugin
- **`.github/workflows/build-companion.yml`** - Automatic build script for GitHub Actions
- **`README.md`** - Documentation for the repository
- **`.gitignore`** - Tells GitHub what files to ignore
- **`GITHUB_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - Detailed setup instructions

## 🚀 Upload Steps (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click "+" in top right → "New repository"
3. **Repository name**: `zoom-connection-plugin` (or your choice)
4. **Make it Public** ✅ (required for automatic releases)
5. **Don't** initialize with README (we have our own)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Upload Files
Choose **Option A** (easier) or **Option B** (if you know Git):

#### Option A: Upload via Website (Recommended)
1. On your new repository page, click "uploading an existing file"
2. **Drag and drop** all contents of this "Companion App" folder
3. **Important**: Make sure the folder structure is preserved:
   ```
   your-repo/
   ├── companion-app/          ← Source code folder
   ├── .github/workflows/      ← Build automation
   ├── README.md              ← Documentation
   └── .gitignore             ← Git configuration
   ```
4. Scroll down, add commit message: "Initial upload of Zoom Connection Plugin"
5. Click "Commit changes"

#### Option B: Git Command Line
```bash
# Clone your empty repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

# Copy all files from "Companion App" folder to here
# Then commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Initial upload of Zoom Connection Plugin"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Watch the Magic Happen
1. Go to your repository → "Actions" tab
2. You should see "Build Zoom Connection Plugin" running
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for it to complete
4. Check "Releases" section for your downloadable files

### Step 4: Configure Your Web App
1. In your `movkafqkx8.html` file, find this line:
   ```javascript
   const GITHUB_REPO = 'yourusername/yourrepository';
   ```
2. Replace with your actual GitHub details:
   ```javascript
   const GITHUB_REPO = 'johnsmith/zoom-connection-plugin';
   ```
3. Save and upload your web app files
